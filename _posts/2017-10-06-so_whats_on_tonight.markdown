It's getting to be time to mark my first portfolio project as complete. Coding a gem from scratch has been the most challenging excersise to date and I have come out the other side with a much deeper understanding of the core concepts of Ruby, as well as what goes into creating even a simple program.

The first obstacle was to find a page to scrape that offered enough information to make for an interesting app. It was also important to take into consideration the HTML of said page and whether or not it would make for a reasonable scraping platform.

I watch a good amount of TV, and with the fall season upon us, TV listings of tonight's new episodes seemed like a natural pick. Luckily, the good people at TVGuide.com were kind enough to have well-structured HTML that made most of the information easy to scrape.

However, for me the real challenge was less finding the right data to scrape, and more how to put it all together in a working package. While I understood how the pieces would fit together from an abstract point of view, I found it somewhat difficult to actually make my various files read from each other and interact in the correct manner. Now, after hours of tinkering, my app is complete. The feeling that I get from seeing something that I built actually work is like nothing else.

Though the course-work so far has been invaluable in my coding journey, it really is something else to put together your own program from scratch. I learned a ton from doing this project and look forward to my next big challenge.
