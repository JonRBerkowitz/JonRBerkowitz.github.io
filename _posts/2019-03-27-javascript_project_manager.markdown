This is where it all start to come together. For a large part of this course, I have learned about how the backend of a website functions. Sure, I had some basic HTML and CSS under my belt but this unit has really brought all of that knowledge together and expanded on it in ways that still make my head spin a little.

This project was a ton of fun. Using my accumulated knowledge, I created a website that not only features data persistance, but is able to use that data in a dynamic way in real time. All of the pieces have fallen into place and for the first time, I feel like I have the chops to build a functioning website from top to bottom.

Using my last project as a base, this site is a similar project management application. However, gone are the days of weird work arounds and constant page re-renders. Every piece of this site is generated dynamically on the fly though AJAX and jQuery. Handlebars also made it a snap to piece together robust templates that leverage each other to generate and update projects, tasks and notes.

Looking forward to learning about how to use React to make something even better next time.
