The subject of my Rails project is an app that I call Task Master. It's not perfect but its a long time in the making. It marks a the renewal of my commitment to this program, and learning to become a developer.

After changing jobs a year ago, I was feeling happy and fulfilled. Dreams of becoming a developer slipped from my radar. I neglected me lessons for months at a time. But then everything changed. I lost my job and things began to get real. I really need a new job. So while I AM still looking for a job in the meantime before I complete my lessons, I am fully reinvigoated and ready to learn. I'm hungry for that developer job like I was when I started this program. So here we are at the Ruby on Rails final project.

Again, I call it Task Master. I've worked on it in bits in pieces over the span of months, but recently picked it back up, finished implementing the features that I wanted and rewrote swaths of code. What does it do? Essentially its a group project management tool. A user can log in, create a project that contains multiple tasks and assign those tasks to themselves or someone else. Pretty straightforward really. It might seem mundane, but for me, this is the start to a whole new leg of my journey and I'm honestly thrilled to be back on track.
