Want to build something build don't know where to start? Sometimes you just need a good jumping off point. Here are three great media-based APIs that you can work into your next project. Whether you're into movies and TV, music, or gaming, there is an API for you.

### The Movie Database

[Movie Database API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api)

The Movie Database is an extensive resource that allows you to gather information about movies, TV shows or even actors. TV shows can be searched via title, season or episode. Queries can even be combined in order to get information like “HIghest grossing Tom Cruise movies with an R rating.” Here is a very small sample of some of the basic information available via their API:

* Overview
* Running Time
* Tagline
* Genre
* Poster
* Star Rating

Some sample app ideas:
1. Track movies you’d like to see/have seen
2. Create movie marathon lists based on actor/genre/running time etc
3. A movie trivia game

### Spotify

[Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/quick-start/)

Spotify's API of course allows you to view data on various artists, albums, and tracks. But what it also allows you to access is user data. Using the Spotify API, you can see a user's listening habits, their playlists, or even control their music player.

Some sample app ideas:
1. Mixtape: Create personalized playlists for other users
2. Customize your playlists with user-uploaded images
3. Create data visualizations based on the listening habits of you and your friends

### Steam

[Steam API](https://steamcommunity.com/dev)

Steam is probably the biggest online platform for downloading and playing PC games. Their API can get information about current gaming news, various statistics sorted by game or user, and data like "Total Time Played" or "Achievements"

Some sample app ideas:
1. Track or moderate playtime by querying user's "Time Played"
2. Game news aggregator
3. Track achievements and compare with friends

There are of course many API's out there that you can use to start up your next big project and most can be found via a quick Google search. So if you have an interest that you think could make a for a great app, the API you need just might be out there. Happy coding!
