title:  "Is Design Really for Me?"

When it came time to chose a college major, I found myself at a loss. But my roommate was a graphic designer and it seemed like he was enjoying it. So I signed up. So here I am, six years into my design career and I find myself wondering, "Is this really what I want to do for the rest of my life? Or is there another path?"

At my job, I work with proprietary dynamic imaging software. The use of this software requires some rudimentary coding skills. The more I coded, the more I found myself enjoying that aspect of my job. I find myself pushing my limits and finding new ways to get more and more out of our software. The feeling of making my code work gives me immense satisfaction. I decided I wanted more of that. I wanted to do this full time. But I needed to learn how to code real applications in common languages.

So here I am, at the Flatiron School, hoping to forge a new and fulfilling career path.
