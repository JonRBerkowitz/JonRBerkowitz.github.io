It's been a long journey, but here we are. The final project. Of all the subjects that I have learned about at Flatiron, React definitely challenged me the most. At first, it was quite difficult to wrap my head around. The whole idea of props, dispatch and state were totally foreign concepts that I felt like I was never going to grasp. In fact, going into the final project I still didn't really get it.

However, over the course of doing this project, I've come to like React a lot. I've learned so much in completing this project. Though I may not be a grand master of React just yet, I feel confident in my skills to create a dynamic and complex website with it.

The website that I chose to create for this project is a movie tracker. It fetches data from the Movie Database API to create a grid of movie covers that can be clicked on to add to a watchlist. Furhtermore, the title of each movie will take the user to a page where they can see details like plot, runtime and overall rating. Figuring out how to pull in the data from an external API and then save that data in my own Rails API, while also creating and sending a token for authentication took a lot of blood, sweat and tears, but in the end it is so rewarding to see all the pieces come together.

I have a ton of ideas for features to add to this site in the future, but feature creep can be very time consuming and I decided in the end to focus on the MVP and add more robust features in later. Overall, I am very satisfied with the way my project turned out and I cannot wait to officially graduate and begin the job search.
