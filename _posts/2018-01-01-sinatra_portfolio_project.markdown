Wow. This one was a doozy. But I feel like I learned a ton about making a website from start to finish.

For this project, I decided to go with a sort of medical diary. Something that could track symptoms, medications, dosages, etc. The first challenge was planning it all out. Even with what I though was careful planning, I still ended up destroying and rebuilding it a few times before I felt like all of the pieces would fit together. Even now, I'm not totally sure that I did it the "right" way. But I'm happy to say that everything seems to work.

After that was all set up, I got to work building the site itself. I feel like I didn't get a ton of practice back in the HTML/CSS unit, so this seemed like the perfect time to also get a handle on that. After some trial and error with Bootstrap, I have a simple responsive website that I feel pretty good about as a first attempt.

Once my database and styles were good to go, I added a scraper to the seed file in order to populate my database with plenty of symptoms and medications for the user to chooser from. They of course can add their own as well, but this step made the site feel much more robust.

After some final tweaks to the code and HTML, I have a final project that I am proud of. Of course there is room for improvement, but building this from scratch was a ton of fun really helped to solidify some concept I was unsure of.

I look forward to the next project !
